**Heresy II: Athens 450 BC Interactive Fiction**
************************************************

Heresy II is a continuation of the story begun with the T.I.M.E Stories fan expansion
`Heresy <{filename}/pages/heresy.rst>`_.  Like the former, it takes place in the
T.I.M.E Stories universe where you work to solve mysteries and puzzles,  unraveling
plots of enemies planning to exploit the space-time continuum.  Unlike the first installment,
Heresy II is a web-based, narrative-driven experience designed for individual game play 
rather than group sessions. The scenario introduces new mechanics and puzzles tailored for 
solo exploration, allowing players to immerse themselves in the story at their own pace. 

You begin the scenario with your return from the scenario. You are debriefed by your
handlers, but something is amiss... This second chapter quickly shifts the setting to 
ancient Athens, where you must unravel mysteries and confront challenges that test 
your wit and resolve.  How will you untangle the web of secrecy?  What path will you 
choose? 

Heresy II is the final chapter in the Heresy story (see `About <{filename}/pages/about.rst>`_ page), but it may be played as a stand-alone scenario.

Playing the Game
================

Playing Hersey II could not be easier, it is a web-based game.  One can play it on
this website or on itch.io, whichever one finds easiest:

`Play Heresy II from the heresy.mrtrashcan.com website <https://heresy.mrtrashcan.com/heresy2/heresy2.html>`_

`Play Heresy II from the itch.io website <https://myleftgoat.itch.io/heresy2>`_

There are a lot more details on the game available from within the game (e.g. attribution,
external links, etc).


Bonus Material: The Heresy II 'Podcast'
=======================================

***Major spoiler warning!***

Just for fun, we passed the source code to the game to Google's NotebookLM
and asked it to generate a podcast for the game.  It is curious.  It does 
however provide a lot of spoilers, so I would only listen after playing the 
game (or it can be helpful if one is stuck |wink|).  For example, they 
spell out all three endings in detail and how to get to them.

Side note: in the 'podcast', there is mention of things like GLYPH6.  The
GLYPH* codes are used by to represent 'icons' embedded in the text.  When
hearing such references in the podcast, think of single character images.
