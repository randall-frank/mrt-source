**Heresy II: Athens 450 BC Interactive Fiction**
************************************************

Heresy II is a continuation of the story begun with the T.I.M.E Stories fan expansion
`Heresy <{filename}/pages/heresy.rst>`_.  Like the former, it takes place in the
T.I.M.E Stories universe where you work to solve mysteries, puzzles, unravel the plot of 
enemies who plan to exploit the space-time continuum.  Unlike the first installment,
Heresy II is a web-based, narrative-driven experience designed for individual game play 
rather than group sessions. The scenario introduces new mechanics and puzzles tailored for 
solo exploration, allowing players to immerse themselves in the story at their own pace. 

You begin the scenario with your return from the first, where you are debriefed by your
handlers, but something is amiss... The chapter quickly shifts the setting to ancient 
Athens, where you must unravel mysteries and confront challenges that test your wit and 
resolve.  How will you untangle the web of secrecy?  What path will you choose? 

Heresy II is the final chapter in the larger story (see `About <{filename}/pages/about.rst>`_ page), but it may be played as a stand-alone scenario.
