**Heresy: The Spain 1499 NT Board Game**
****************************************

Heresy is a fan expansion of the T.I.M.E Stories board game. 
In T.I.M.E Stories, you and your friends work together to solve 
mysteries and puzzles to unravel the plot of enemies who plan 
to exploit the space-time continuum.
You and your friends will be sent to 1499 Spain. Your boss, Bob, needs you to 
track down and neutralize a rogue T.I.M.E agent, who is using the 
Inquisition as to cover up his plans. Will you and your friend be able to 
find the traitor and stop him before it is too late?

Heresy is the first chapter in a larger story 
(see `About <{filename}/pages/about.rst>`_ page), but it can be 
played as a stand-alone scenario. `Heresy II <{filename}/pages/heresy2.rst>`_ is the
follow-on scenario.

Obtaining the cards
===================

The raw assets and all the necessary tools to build the cards are 
available on github (and the tools can be pip installed, see 
the `tools <{filename}/pages/the-tools.rst>`_ page for details). 
See:  `heresy-assets <https://github.com/randall-frank/heresy-assets>`_ for the files.  
In addition, pre-rendered card files can be downloaded 
from `here <https://github.com/randall-frank/heresy-assets/releases/tag/v1.0.0>`_.

- There is a Steam Workshop plugin for Tabletop Simulator. Search for `"T.I.M.E Stories: Heresy" <http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1240227894>`_ game or click the link.
- PDF file of the card images.  Each PDF page contains the front/back page of 4 cards. You can use this PDF to print directly the cards at home.  These are available in `US Letter <https://randall-frank.github.io/heresy-assets/generated_cards/deck_Letter.pdf>`_ and `A4 <https://randall-frank.github.io/heresy-assets/generated_cards/deck_A4.pdf>`_ format.
- The entire deck, rendered to PNG files (two per card, front and back) at 300DPI can be downloaded from this `link <https://randall-frank.github.io/heresy-assets/>`_.
- We have used the services of makeplayingcards.com to print high-quality copies of Heresy versions in the past.  We tried to get them to let folks access our uploads for ordering prints, but they require us to charge a minimum 10% fee for this.  We are not looking to make any money from this endeavor so unfortunately, if you want to use their service, you will need to upload the cards yourself.  If you choose to use makeplayingcards.com, you may want to use this `deck <https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LjboP7V8x5ID66fxlubJPPPynwGP9D2G>`_ which is the same as the base 300DPI PNG file deck but it includes a 36 pixel bleeding margin. These are the files we print and they look quite nice IMHO.

The cards feel a bit sturdier than the Space Cowboy cards, but the corners are rounded, a tight fit for the card numbers.
