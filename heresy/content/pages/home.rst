**Welcome to the Heresy website!**
**********************************

Heresy is based on the T.I.M.E Stories ecosystem.  The story is told in two chapters.  
The first chapter takes the form of a traditional a fan expansion of the T.I.M.E Stories 
board game. It is in board game form any plays much like the original T.I.M.E Stories 
adventures. The second chapter takes place as the first ends.  This part of the story
has been crafted as a work of web-based interactive fiction.  It brings the overall 
story arc to conclusion.

What are you up against?
========================

In the first chapter you are sent to Spain in 1499 to track down a rogue agent and
hold them accountable for their actions.  Once successful in this endeavor, you return
to the agency to find it somewhat 'changed'.  

The second chapter focuses on the nature of that change and explores somewhat more
philosophical aspects of the agency.  What is the true purpose and motivation of
the agency?  It also explores the nature of the technologies that it employs and
questions their effect on the trajectory of the human experience.

How does one play?
==================

First, while there are some advantages to playing the first before the second, both
have been crafted as stand-alone experiences.  We recognize that not everyone is in
a position to play the board game, but the fact that you are reading this page implies
you should be able to play the second chapter.
