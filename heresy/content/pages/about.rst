**The Road That Led Us Here**
*****************************

Originally, Heresy was planned as three T.I.M.E Stories fan
expansions. The `first chapter <{filename}/pages/heresy.rst>`_ was 
released as such in 2017. A bit later, the complete source code
to the game as well as the tools we used to generate the cards
were made available on GitHub.

Work began on the next chapter around the time the sources were
released.  The plan was to consolidate the second and third chapters
into the next T.I.M.E Stories expansion deck: Heresy II.  The story, 
location layout and basic interaction write-ups were completed in 2018.  
At that point, things stalled and developers moved physically, making 
collaboration on a board game difficult.  

Enter 2025 and we recognized that we had a basic story and write up,
but needed to find a way to get it out to folks.  It was suggested 
that `Heresy II <{filename}/pages/heresy2.rst>`_ be converted into 
an online work of interactive fiction with a bit of a thematic
change.  This solved a number of logistical issues and a working 
Heresy II core was running within 6 months. 

Heresy II is still set in the T.I.M.E Stories universe and is a 
natural follow-on to the original card-based expansion. However,
with the Heresy II installment, there are no further plans for this story line.
To be honest, the ending(s) of Heresy II would make it a bit difficult
to continue the story line, so we will end it here.

The complete Hersey story and has been created under a Creative 
Commons license. We had fun writing the various stories and we
certainly hope you have fun playing them and sharing them with
friends.
