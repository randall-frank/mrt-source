Hersey is the first chapter in a trilogy for a fan-based expansion of 
T.I.M.E Stories. This first chapter has been made available to the 
public in December 2017. The second chapter will become available to 
the public as soon as it is ready (|ss| 2018\ |se| 2025?).

**Breaking news**: Heresy 2 is well along in development.  However, 
it will not be a T.I.M.E Stories scenario.  Rather, it will be an 
web-based interactive story.  The game is already in playable 
format, we hope to be able to release it in 2025.


Hersey has been created under Creative Common license. Everyone is 
welcome to download it, share it, play it. It has been created to 
provide a few hours of fun and entertainment. We enjoyed creating 
it - we hope players will enjoy playing it as well.


The authors do not receive any profit from this game. It is a 
project born by and developed out of sheer passion for board games.
